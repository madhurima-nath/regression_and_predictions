# WWCode Data Science: Statistics Workshop Series - Statistics in Data Science

## Week 4: Regression and Predictions

The following topics are covered in the session. 

- Simple Linear Regression		
- Multiple Linear Regression		
- Real-world Example

The New York air quality data ([details about dataset](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/airquality.html)) is used for the analysis in the [R notebook](https://github.com/mnathvt/regression_and_predictions/blob/main/regression_prediction.Rmd). [Download data from Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/pratiksagrawal/practice-data-set-for-air-quality?select=airquality.csv).
